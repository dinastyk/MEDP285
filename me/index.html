      <br>
      Dinasty Kelly is a Computer Science and Emerging Media student at Hunter College.<br>
       
      As a Queer, Black woman, her upbringing consists of being raised in two contrasting enviornments,
      Puerto Rico and New York City.<br> Her work explores what home and familiarity
      are to her and how it may either coincide with or contrast society's
      conventional ideas. She use several mediums in her work, including film
      photography, digital photography, clay-making, mixed media, and writing to
      traverse how class, race, sexuality and gender influence her position in
      this world, including her inner-world and in relation to her culture. She
      shows the viewer how nuanced yet divergent history and present-time is,
      and how she is learning to embrace it all.
